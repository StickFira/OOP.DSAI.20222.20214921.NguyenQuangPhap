Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: Java does not allow you to make constructor methods with same number of arguments and arguments data type ('title' and 'category' use same data type 'String').
